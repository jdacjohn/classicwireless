            </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">The information gathered by classicwireless.org 
              falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors 
              to the site when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) 
              tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through classicwireless.org. 
              Third party providers featured on or linked to by our site, such 
              as vendors of products and services offered through our site, may 
              be gathering the same kinds of information. </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">The information you provide us during a visit 
              to classicwireless.org helps us to improve the quality and utility 
              of our site. The more information you share with us, the better 
              we can serve your needs.</p>
            <p class="bodystyle">When you purchase phones, equipment, or accessories, 
              we request the following information on our order form:</p>
            <p class="bodystyle">Name<br>

            <p class="bodystyle">If you provide us your email address, from time 
              to time we may send you email about new products and services, or 
              offers that we believe will interest you. Though we hope you'll

            <p class="bodystyle">To help us tailor our site to the needs and interests 
              of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users 
              by placing a small entry in text file, called a cookie, on your 
              hard drive. The cookie contains an ID number that allows us to track 
              the pages you've visited. We aggregate this data with data on the 
              pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns. 
              We use this information to improve our site by making it more responsive 
              to the needs of our users. The help function on most browsers contains 
              information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting 
              a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept 
              cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various features 
              on our site that are available to other visitors. </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">Our vendor's web server automatically collects 
              your IP address when you request pages from our server. Your IP 
              address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet 
              to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you 
              request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell us who 
              you are. We also collect information on the browser software you're 
              using to access our site so we can optimize our site for the most 
              popular browsers. And, because we like to know how you found our 
              site, we keep track of where you came from. </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">Of course, our site includes links to other websites, 
              and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, 
              whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another 
              website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions 
              through our website, use of any information you provide is governed 
              by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting 
              or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information 
              in the course of obtaining products or services through our site, 
              use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy 
              policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it 
              appears that you're on classicwireless.org pages throughout the 
              transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. 
              If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners 
              via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on 
              which the products or services are offered, you should contact the 
              provider directly for more information. </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">The information we collect from our visitors 
              is stored within a database we do not control. However, Physical 
              access to the servers on which we store visitor information is restricted. 
              To protect the privacy of your credit card number and other ordering 
              information, we encrypt this information for transit over the Internet 
              using a Secure Socket Layer (&quot;SSL&quot;) connection. However, 
              as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is 
              impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, 
              nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted 
              while being transmitted over the Internet. </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">Most web browsers allow use of an SSL connection. 
              If your browser does not support use of an SSL connection, or if 
              you prefer not to send your credit card number over the Internet, 
              you can place your order by calling us toll free at 1-888-698-0123 
              (U.S. only). </p>
            <p class="bodystyle">The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to 
              change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post 
              the new policy promptly. If at any point we decide to use personally 
              identifiable information in a manner different from what was stated 
              at the time it was collected, we will notify you and give you an 
              opportunity to opt out of the proposed use. By using classicwireless.org, 
              you agree that your visit to our site, and any dispute over privacy,
